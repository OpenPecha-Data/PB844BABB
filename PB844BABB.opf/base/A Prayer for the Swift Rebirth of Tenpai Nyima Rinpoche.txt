A Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Tenpai Nyima Rinpoche
by Namkha Drimed Rinpoche

om swasti
Oṃ svasti!
lumé könchok sé ché den tob dang
Through the power and truth of the unfailing rare and supreme ones together with their heirs,
khyepar tsokyé gyalwé tukkyé tü
And the force of the enlightened aspirations of the Lake-born Conqueror in particular,
tsungmé lama tenpé nyima yi
May the supreme emanation of this incomparable guru, the Sun of the Teachings,
choktrul da shyön truldral nyur jön shok
Appear like a youthful moon, swiftly and unmistakably!

cher nyikdü kyi mün rum trikpa yi
In the dense darkness of this exceedingly degenerate age,
ten drö dé kyi nangwa geb gyur na
When the light of joy for the teachings and beings lies hidden,
dzamling gyalpö ta dün trinlé wang
May this sun, so powerful in its activity, like a king for all the world,
lar yang nordzin nyen du nyur jön shok
Swiftly return once more as companion to the wealth-bearing earth!

lhakpar gangjong deden drowa nam
For the faithful beings of the Land of Snows in particular:
yalwar ma dor tukkyé damchepé
Do not neglect us, but through your aspirations and commitments,
tsenpé dak sok gön du nyur shyé né
Return swiftly with all the marks and signs as our lord and protector,
namtar gyalwa kün dang yermé shok
Indistinguishable in life and liberation from all the victorious ones!

When the sublime Tenpai Nyima Rinpoche, supreme incarnation, genuine yogin and sovereign of
the teachings at Traling Monastery, the seat of King Gesar in this world, displayed the signs
of resting his enlightened mind in the realm of peace, a request for a swift rebirth prayer
(accompanied by the support of offerings) arrived from his nephew, the sublime Chagtrul
Thupten Thinley. Thus, I, Namkha Drimed Rabjam, the awareness-holder who is sustained
by the blessings of the Great Lion Gesar, made this heartfelt aspiration on the 25th day of
the fourth Tibetan month (9 June 2018). May it be fulfilled!
